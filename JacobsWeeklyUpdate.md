- Weston's fix helped me, but I am comparing inconsistent methods (Larsen's to Hansen's I think), which means the coefficients I am feeding in are wrong.

- TestingTestTesting :) possibly the best file name I have ever come up with, I learned how to do several different types of tests and will be implementing it in a separation point test file
